I walked across the street

I saw through brand new eyes

A world that I was missing

That I was hypnotized

<br/>

Trancelike in routine

Narrowed field of vision

Eyes have now adjusted

Seeing with precision

<br/>

I saw a studio

I saw a little inn

I saw the same old cars go by

But not the same within

<br/>

Glancing back to whence I came

A world unrecognized

I walked across the street again

Familiar fear in stride
