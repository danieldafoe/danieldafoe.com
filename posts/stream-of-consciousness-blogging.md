## Transcript

This is a test audio recording. This is stream of consciousness me recording audio, which I suppose I literally just mentioned. 

[Chuckles]

I had an idea to publish an audio-based blog post because I feel more of a connection to stream of consciousness communication. I feel that I can express myself better and I feel that you get to really understand and see a different side of people and probably a more deeply accurate uh side of people when you get to hear them trip over their words or find words in order to express themselves...and I think that's another big part for me, too, is that I think that I have a lot of difficulty expressing myself, at least how I'm feeling and reflecting and introspecting, uh by any other means except kind of stream of consciousness communication. You know, Iâ€”I think my partner might say differently, perhaps they believe that I also struggle audibly, verbally, but that's besides the point. It's not the point of this post. 

Instead, I want this to be an exploration for myself, um to be able to publish posts in a different format in a different mode, um, and also to challenge myself in a way, um, to produce something within my blog that, um, I don't have as much experience doing, which is media and, uh, making sure that I make that accessible to everyone as well. Um, I like, I like putting challenges upon myself and I think that this is one that will be really fun to do. 

So without further ado, here is my blog post. Just kidding. This is actually the end of the blog post, so without further ado didn't really make much sense. 

But that's okay. Um, thanks for listening.
