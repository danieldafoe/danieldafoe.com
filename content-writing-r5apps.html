              <h1>Content Writing for R5APPS</h1>
              <p>
                R5APPS is a company that is able to design, develop, and deploy mobile applications. They can build off of others' ideas, start from scratch, or simply refactor an existing application on the market.
                
              </p>
              <p>
                For this company I was in charge of the creation of the main tagline, the ideation and writing of each blurp under the Services section, and helping work out a pricing strategy for their development services.
                
              </p>
              <h3>Tagline</h3>
              <p>
                When conceiving the tagline for R5APPS, I wanted to give consumers the idea that apps produced by R5APPS were one-of-a-kind. By explaining that each app is "meticulously designed and engineered", the feeling is conveyed that R5APPS spends a lot of time planning the app's look and feel for user friendliness, and also takes time to iron out any kinks when developing it.
                
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only was this my first full-fledge website as a whole, but I also familiarized myself with SASS by using it as my CSS preprocessor. This was also my first time that I tried out Bootstrap in order to handle mobile responsiveness.
                
              </p>
              <h3>Descriptions</h3>
              <p>
                The descriptions under each category in Services were also a product of mine. Each service needed to convey to consumers that R5APPS knows what they're talking about, but are equally friendly as they are knowledgeable.
                
              </p>
              <p>By using tidbits of playful language (i.e., goodies, magic) I aimed to abstract away some of the seriousness and let a more human and friendly brand image show through.</p>
