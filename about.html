However, I've also written some things below if you'd prefer a different reading experience. </p><ul><li><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/danieldafoe">LinkedIn</a></li><li><a href="https://linkedin.com/in/danieldafoe">GitHub</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.com/danieldafoe">Medium</a></li></ul><h2>Quick Facts <span role="presentation">‚è≤</span></h2><ol><li>I've spoken at a11yTO Camp about the future of web accessibility. I demonstrated and chatted about the SpeechSynthesis and SpeechRecognition Web APIs.
</li><li>While I don't do it as often as I'd like, I love to write. I've posted a few things on Medium,
and I'm going to start contributing more‚Äìincluding technical articles.
</li><li>I love to take - and edit - pictures. I'm not super professional, but I get a lot of joy out of being satisfied with a photo I've taken.
</li><li>I have two black pugs, Maisie and Hector. They're basically my children. </li></ol><h2>Who I Am <span role="presentation">ü§™</span></h2><p>To begin, I'd like to formally introduce this website. This is my playground. This website is a place where I can experiment with both code and design. I can test and iterate on the experiences I present and compose the sort of content I'd like to‚Äìincluding dangling prepositions.
</p><p>Because I believe that people are more than their job title, I'll start by sharing some things about myself.
</p><p>I love learning about languages‚Äìhow they're different and how they're the same. Learning about their grammar structure is particularly fascinating to me. I'm a monolingual, but I can produce a decent chunk of Mandarin. I also happen to know a couple unpleasant things in Czech, among other things.
</p><h2>Job <span role="presentation">üè¶</span></h2><p>Currently, I'm a <strong>Senior Front-End Developer</strong> at RBC in Toronto, Ontario. In my current role I work with a front-end stack involving Angular, ngrx, and Sass. </p><p>Previously I've worked as a Quality Assurance Analyst and Hybrid Mobile App Developer. At various points in my life I've even worked at McDonald's, IKEA, and The Bay.
</p><h2>Education <span role="presentation">üéì</span></h2><p>I'm currently doing a part-time double major in Linguistics and English at the University of Toronto. Before that, I graduated from a 3-year program at Sheridan College in Systems Analysis. Prior to that I
studied Advertising for 2 years at Mohawk College.
