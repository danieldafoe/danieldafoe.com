            Inclusiveness and accessibility matter most to me when designing and building web experiences.

          p. 
            My introduction to the world of web accessibility was in 2013 when tasked with testing internal 
            applications at RBC with a screen reader, JAWS. Since then it has been a principle of mine that 
            everything I produce is usable by everyone.

          p.
            Since becoming enlightened about the impact my choices have on the experience of users, 
            I have given talks about accessibility to developers and designers at RBC, 
            and even presented at a11yTO Conf 2015 about the future of web accessibility.
