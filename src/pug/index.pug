  h1 Hi, I'm Daniel.

  p.intro I'm an inclusive designer and software engineer with a curious, collaborative, and optimistic lens on the world.

  p I work full-time at Apple as a #[strong Senior Web Accessibility Engineer]. My main job is to make sure the #[a(href="https://apple.com/store") Apple Online Store] is usable by everyone. This involves a great deal of coordination, advocacy, education, and technical solutioning.

  p Previous to Apple, I spent 8 years at #[a(href='https://rbc.com') RBCâ€”Canada's largest bank]. I was on product teams as a Technical Lead and Front-End Engineer, and worked as a Senior Design Technologist on a design system team. I also spent a lot of my time helping designers and software engineers understand how to create inclusive and accessible experiences.
