          I've spoken at a11yTO Camp about the future of web accessibility. I demonstrated

          While I don't do it as often as I'd like, I love to write. I've posted a few things on Medium,
          and I'm going to start contributing more‚Äìincluding technical articles.

        li.
          I love to take - and edit - pictures. I'm not super professional, but I get a lot of joy 
          out of being satisfied with a photo I've taken.

        li.
          I have two black pugs, Maisie and Hector. They're basically my children.


      h2 Who I Am #[span(role='presentation') ü§™]

      p.
        To begin, I'd like to formally introduce this website. This is my playground. 
        This website is a place where I can experiment with both code and design. I can 
        test and iterate on the experiences I present and compose the sort of content 
        I'd like to‚Äìincluding dangling prepositions.

      p.
        Because I believe that people are more than their job title, I'll start by sharing 
        some things about myself.
        
      p.
        I love learning about languages‚Äìhow they're different and how they're the same. 
        Learning about their grammar structure is particularly fascinating to me. I'm a 
        monolingual, but I can produce a decent chunk of Mandarin. I also happen to know a 
        couple unpleasant things in Czech, among other things.
