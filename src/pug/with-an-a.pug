            This vagrant in the background is Daniel Defoe. An author. A politician. A thief. 
            He is the reason Google believes I don't exist. When you Google my name, results will show for 
            him.

          p.
            Daniel Defoe has stolen my identity and my presence on the web.

          p.
            I will not stand for this.

          p.
            And don't worryâ€“the irony of me writing about him entangling our lives further is not lost on me.
            
          p.
            So be it.
