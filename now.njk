        In May 2025, I'm going to Japan and South Korea. I've always wanted to visit Japan specifically, so I'm incredibly excited. I'm already upping my Japanese language skills through Duolingo. My favourite word I've learned so far (outside Duolingo) is tokidoki ().

        I live in California. The weather is a nice change from Toronto, Canada, but other than that it leaves much to be desired.
