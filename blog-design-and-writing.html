              <h1>Blog Design and Writing</h1>
              <p>
                As a fairly new venture, my personal blogging website is still very much <em>in the works</em>. Though presentable enough to make it live, I am far from calling it complete.
              </p>
              <p>
                To make sure I got something a little more technical out of a blog website instead of simply content creation, I decided to throw myself into to the world of Drupal, a big player in the Content Management System (CMS) world.
              </p>
              <p>
                <strong>Update:</strong> As of July 2015, I have decided to switch from using Drupal as my blogging platform to using straightforward static pages. Due to performance hits I took with Drupal and being unable to diagnose them, I've decided to go this route.
              </p>
              <p>
                The plan is to move to serving my static blog pages using Jekyll, but this will be changed over when I have time to do so. This change was quick and so I felt comfortable spending some time on it.
              </p>

            <div class="proj-info-text">
              <h3>Rationale</h3>
              <p>
                After aquainting myself with the documentation I decided to dive right into styling my own Drupal theme in order to make it look how I wanted, and then made sure I perused the administration aspect to give my blogs clean URLs to improve SEO. Aside from learning more about Drupal administration, I also plan on getting into the PHP files to further customize.
              </p>

              <p>
                One thing that is not acceptable about this project is the server response time. The blog appears to load very slowly and does not receive favourable scores on PageSpeed Insights. I have therefore been taking steps to improve the speed of my Drupal blog in order to better acquiant myself with best practices for optimization.
