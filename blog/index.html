              Welcome to the first installment of <em>User Experience Gripes</em>.
              This is a compilation (however small it may be) of user experience oddities
              that I have picked up around the web during my usual browsing experience.
              Although the list may seem short for installment numero uno, don't fret!
              There is <em>always</em> more to question.
