          If you found yourself asking any one of these in your own head, I heard you loud and clear. Indulge yourself by reading further.

        <h3>What is Usability?</h3>
        <p>
          Usability deals with the ease-of-use of a website, software, product, or environment, allowing users to learn to use it effortlessly, complete tasks efficiently, and have a pleasant experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          Donald Norman, an important figure in the area of effective design, is the creator of the terms "allowance" and "signifier" that I will refer to.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Affordances</strong> are cues that indicate how things <em>can</em> be used. A prime example of this is a down facing caret that we so typically find for dropdown menus in order to indicate that either hovering or clicking (we don't know which) with your mouse will reveal some more information or options.
          <img src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/facebook-caret-affordance1.png" alt="[Facebook downward caret affordance]" style="float:right; margin:.75em"/> Facebook has some items stored in this down-pointing caret, but what will the options be related to? What can we expect to find?
        </p>

        <p>
          It's exceedingly difficult to produce designs that, with a single look, will depict what the user can expect to happen if they interact with something. In the case of Facebook, they've actually lumped items from a few categories into the expanded list, which brings about problems with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_architecture" target="_blank">information architecture</a> as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>Signifiers</strong> are cues that indicate how things <em>should</em> be used. In the grand scheme of things, signifiers and allowances are quite similar&mdash;especially when concerned with the world wide web.
        </p>

        <p>
          The most renowned signifier in the world wide web is one you interact with every day&mdash;the mouse pointer. How else would you know you can click something you're hovering over to follow its link to a new page or open a PDF? Our use of computers (specifically the Internet) has helped us learn what the change from an arrow to a pointing hand <em>means</em>.
        </p>

        <h3>Intuitive or Learnable?</h3>
        <p>
          How do we design something in such a way that its purpose and function is intuitively known? Well, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jef_Raskin" target="_blank">Jef Raskin</a> has argued that the term <em>intuitive</em> should not be applied to user interface design and should instead be substituted for <em>learnable</em>. Learnable implies that through consistent exposure and repetition, something can become established in the way "this means that".
        </p>

        <p>
          Relating this thought to affordances and signifiers, we begin to understand Jef's argument. Icons such as a bell have been learned by users over the years to signify alerts or notifications.  <img src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/07/wordpress-how-is-it-clickable.png" alt="[Wordpress alert button learned functionality]" style="float:left; margin:.75em .75em 0 0; width:170px; height:auto"/>
        </p>

        <p>
          However, the globe icon on Facebook has always told users that that's where they should go for their notifications. Is it fair to say that one is <em>more intuitive</em> than the other? Below is a table comparison I whipped up that examines each icon and its relationship to notifications and alerts.
        </p>

        <table>
          <thead>
            <th colspan="2">Facebook vs. Wordpress</th>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr>
              <td><strong>Globe</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Bell</strong></td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Voices from around the world?</td>
              <td>Chimes to alert</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>World news?</td>
              <td>Dinner bell notifies</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
              <td>Large, lots of people</td>
              <td>Loud, brings attention</td>
            </tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>

        <p>
          The winner is clear-cut, but what does this mean? Sure, it means that Wordpress' choice of icon is much more logical than Facebook's, but does that mean that as long as behaviour is learnable (e.g., clicking a certain icon for notifications) that the icon isn't important? I would say no, but I suppose that's up for debate.
        </p>

        <h3>Designing for Usability</h3>
        <p>
          Usability is perceived, and can therefore only be subjectively measured by performing tests such as user acceptance. While grabbing anyone off of the street would give you great results for a broad demographic, ideally you should have your testers fall under your target market. This ensures that your system is understandable and usable by those it was designed for.
        </p>

        <p>
          Although usability is subjective, there are quantitative ways of measuring it. Imagine someone being given a scenario that they are to complete by using your system. How would you measure their success? Here are a few ways:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>How many navigational errors did the user encounter during the task?</strong> Errors give you a form of measurement for how usable your system may be. If a user can complete the task(s) without taking a wrong turn or clicking an incorrect button, you're doing something right. How detailed your error criteria gets is up to you, but you should be concerning yourself with unrequired clicks and navigational failures at the very least.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How long did it take the user to accomplish the task?</strong> Measuring the quickness of the completion will give you insight into a wide range of factors: button clarity (e.g., wording, color), information architecture (e.g., navigation structure), process descriptions (e.g., marketing or help text), and many others. If desired, break this test down into areas such as "time per page" or "scroll time".
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>How many clicks did the user make before completion?</strong> Observing the number of interactions a user makes with their mouse is a good opportunity to both reinforce the error test, as well as have another form of measurement. With this test you already know how many clicks it <em>should</em> take, so all you need to do is record, compare, and analyze.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          The list above gives you a baseline with which you can work. Once you have the completion time or error count, you can take steps to reduce them.
        </p>

        <h3>Measuring Success</h3>
        <p>
          Discussing monetary benefits of usability testing (and engineering) is tough. It's therefore infinitely more difficult to pursuade upper management to invest in it.
        </p>

        <p>
          <strong>You:</strong> "Well sir, if we're able to improve our users' workflow by helping them navigate the site faster-"
          <br/><strong>Manager:</strong> "If they're blazing through pages then how likely is it they'll click an ad?"
        </p>

        <p>
          Suddenly you're lost. It's difficult to persuade someone wearing dollar sign contacts that trusting in UX has its benefits. Most of them believe that if the task isn't adding new, innovative functionality that new subscribers will <em>die for</em>, it isn't worth a damn.
        </p>

        <h4>Prove 'em Wrong</h4>
        <p>
          But let's analyze this. If you're trying to improve your users' workflow, it's likely they're going to start navigating your site with unprecendented ease and speed. Now, what that also means is that you've focused all of their actions into a singular stream, giving yourself the opportunity to <span class="u-strike">bombard</span> present the user with advertisements or marketing material that you <em>know</em> they'll see.
        </p>

        <p>
          So you've went from hoping and praying that the strategically placed ads on your website will gain clicks, to presenting them to the user when they're in a good mood from being able to navigate your site well and accomplish their tasks efficiently. Sounds promising, no?
        </p>

        <p>
           In the case your numberless rant falls on deaf ears, try to explain that according to research by <a href="http://www.uie.com/publications/whitepapers/PogoSticking.pdf" target="_blank">User Interface Engineering</a>, you're 225% more likely to get a sale by supplying the right information to your visitors at the right time. Figuring out the "right time" is something that only testing and engineering your site for users can do.
        </p>

        <h3>Remarks</h3>
        <p>
          With usability at your side, you don't need to push users down the purchase funnel, you can lead them by the hand. It should not be ignored nor treated as an after-thought. Follow usability engineering from the get-go and there will be less groaning down the road.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you were a waiter and wanted your guests to tip you well, would you give them a crap experience and ignore their needs? Unlikely.
