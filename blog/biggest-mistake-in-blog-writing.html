        <p>
          If you found nothing wrong with the above fragment, please consider taking another look and revising your opinion.  What I'm here to talk about today is punctuation, grammar, and spelling errors in blog posts, and how they really just come down to laziness.
        </p>

        <p>
          Proofreading is an essential part of being an online blogger, journalist, reviewer, or what have you. Not only can it save the opinions of your readers about what you wrote and you as a writer, but it also gives you a chance to revisit what you've written. There's no shame in revising something that you had considered finished.
          <h3>Online Tools</h3>
          In the digital age (which, by the way, is now) where tools to improve your own shortcomings are in abundance, there's no excuse for making simple mistakes such as <strong>you're /</strong> <strong>your </strong>and <strong>there / their / they're</strong>.
        </p>

        <p>
          Websites such as <a title="Grammarly" href="http://grammarly.com" target="_blank">grammarly.com</a> offer free (with registration, mind you) grammar, sentence structure, punctuation, and spelling edits to your uploaded text.  It's as simple as taking your prepared blog post or news article and uploading the file or plain text to the site and clicking "Check your text".
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, you <em>should </em>have proofread the post several times yourself (over a number of days for best results) and given it to a colleague or friend to check over before using an online tool.
        </p.

        <h3>Selecting an Online Tool</h3>
        <p>
          Now, just because these online tools exist does not mean that we should rely on their merit alone. For instance, after doing a little research for this very blog post, I came across <a title="grammarcheck.net" href="http://grammarcheck.net" target="_blank">grammarcheck.net</a>. While its purpose is obvious and its intent is benevolent, it falls short to do what it is it actually <em>wants</em> to do correctly: check grammar. Observe my screenshot below for a chuckle:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img stlye="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:660px; max-width:100%; height:361px;"  src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/grammar-check-fail.png?w=660" alt="Grammar check fail image." />
        </p>

        <p>
          I suppose I can't expect much from the "Free Check".  Still, it worries me that the mistake I inserted should have been an easy one to catch.
        </p>

        <h3>Consequences</h3>
        <p>
          You may be wondering how this all relates to writing blogs. (If you're seriously wondering that, please seek professional help.) This likely won't come as a surprise to regular bloggers or article writers, but this topic relates directly to your blog or news site.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm going to venture to guess that I'm not alone in saying that I will without a doubt become uninterested in an article if I find too many mistakes within it. Here are some negative outcomes of having <s>a few</s> mistakes in your writing:
        </p>

        <h4>You take the reader out of the experience.</h4>
        <p>
          By allowing spelling, punctuation, or grammar to get in the way of your article , you risk prohibiting your reader to do exactly what they clicked on your article to do.  When a reader comes face-to-face with a mistake, they are taken out of the experience of enjoying your article.  It's as if you're physically poking the user in the side while they attempt to read your content.
        </p>

        <h4>You put your brand in a negative light.</h4>
        <p>
          Each time a reader comes across a mistake, a little shred of your credibility is lost.
        </p>

        <p>
          "Why did they not proofread their content?"
        </p>
        <p>
          "Don't they care about what they post?"
        </p>

        <h4>You can lose a subscriber.</h4>
        <p>
          Depending on how forgiving your reader is, coming across little mistakes where a letter is left off a word or a couple letters are jumbled up may not necessarily get you one less subscriber.
        </p>

        <p>
          However, if you're unfortunate enough to have readers like myself, they will not be so forgiving â€” especially with crucial mistakes. For instance, in an article I <em>would have</em> finished reading this morning had a paragraph that looked like this:
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/03/medium-article-mistakes.png?w=660" alt="Medium.com article mistakes" stlye="display:block; margin:0 auto; width:660px; height:261px;"/>
        </p>

        <p>
          That was the second paragraph of the article. With mistakes that early on, I knew I was likely to be ill-prepared for what I would encounter later.
        </p>

        <p>
          If you derive any positive idea from this, it would be best if you had errors somewhere in the middle of your article. With this approach - and please don't take this as an invitation to only proofread the beginning and end - you've already hooked the reader and they may be more likely to ignore a mistake here or there because they want to finish the entire article.
        </p>

        <h3>Avoiding Mistakes</h3>
        <p>
          Avoiding mistakes is a straightforward process.  You should be doing all that you can to get your post proofread by friends and colleagues before it's released to the public.
        </p>

        <p>
          On top of that, use an online tool or piece of software to help you out. You shouldn't rely on tools or software alone, but they may pick up something your sentient help did not.
        </p>

        <h3>Closing Remarks</h3>
        <p>
          Whether you're writing a blog post about your adorable cat or your pet rock, make sure that your don't burden your readers with atrocious punctuation, grammar and spelling mistakes.
        </p>

        <p>
          Though, if you absolutely need to write a train wreck of a sentence or two, I would recommend you convince your subconscious to do it in the middle of the post.
