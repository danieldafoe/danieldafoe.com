          Welcome. You've chosen the 3rd coming of <em>User Experience Gripes</em>,
          an indefinitely occurring saga of concerns I have with the way companies have
          neglected aspects of their website's usability and therefore ignored
          user experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          This issue focuses on usability.gov, , placeholder,
          and placeholder. Enjoy the read.
        </p>

        <h3>Usability.gov</h3>
        <p>
          If you're thinking what I'm thinking, then you know what this means. Yes, a website that provides information on UX has an issue with the very thing it claims to understand.
        </p>

        <img alt="[Usability.gov confusing side menu icons]" src="../../images/usability-gov-unclear-sidebar.png" style="max-width:100%; width:100%; max-width:80px; height:auto; float:left; margin:1em 2em 0 0;"/>

        <p>
          Closeby is a screenshot of the side navigation that appears on the usability.gov website. As you can see, it uses only icons to convey the meaning of each box that you can click on. (Who knew?)
        </p>

        <p>
          Let's take it from the top. The top icon screams <a href="http://git.com" target="_blank">git repo</a> to me, but that seems unlikely. A second guess would be that it's related to making connections or getting further details.
        </p>

        <p>
          Alas, it has nothing to do with any of my educated guesses. "Methods" text appears when the icon is hovered over, which - of course - further confuses me. Are these methods of addressing usability? Methods of madness?
        </p>

        <!--
        <img alt="[Usability.gov confusing side menu icons with text]" src="../../images/usability-gov-hover-top.png" style="max-width:100%; width:100%; max-width:200px; height:auto; float:right; margin:1em 0 0 2em;"/>
      -->

        <p>
          Clicking the icon/text brought me to a page with a title, two icons side-by-side, and no description of what I was looking at. So...am I just, like, supposed to click around? (The 'x' for this tab looks appealing.)
        </p>

        <h4>Informing the user</h4>
        <p>
          If your goal is to have users interact with something on your site, then it's wise to let them know that they <em>can</em>. You can use appropriate icons; you can use descriptive text; hell, you can even use CSS animations to point an arrow at what you want them to do. Above all, let them know where they can find what they're looking for. Usability.gov does a great job demonstrating what not to do:
        </p>

        <img alt="[Usability.gov unclear page purpose]" src="../../images/usability-gov-methods-views.png" style="max-width:100%; width:100%;height:auto; margin:0 auto 1em auto;"/>

        <p>
          With no text to describe what the purpose of this page is or what information you can find, users are left guessing. It's unlikely a typical user will even know that the icons under the title toggle the view-type of the boxes.
        </p>
