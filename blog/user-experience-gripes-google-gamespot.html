          Welcome to the first installment of <em>User Experience Gripes</em>.
          This is a compilation (however small it may be) of user experience oddities
          that I have picked up around the web during my usual browsing experience.
          Although the list may seem short for installment numero uno, don't fret!
          There is <em>always</em> more to question.
        </p>

        <p>
          Without further ado, let's begin with the first culprit.
        </p>

        <h3>Google</h3>
        <p>
          The King of Search is great at building emotionally engaging web experiences
          and I've always truly valued their work in the world of web design. Although
          Google has been scorned before by some of the web community for their
          <a href="http://www.google.com/inbox/" target="_blank">use of "scrolljacking"</a> -
          whereby a website attempts to control the speed and fluency at which you can scroll -
          I've picked something different to discuss.
        </p>

        <p>
          Below is a screenshot taken from Google's <a href="http://developers.google.com/web/tools/polymer-starter-kit">
            Polymer Starter Kit</a> page, which is still live as of today. If you
            analyze the icon with the titles of the selling points of Polymer, you
            may notice that the icons are a bit ambiguous.
        </p>

        <p>
          <img alt="[Google Polymer Starter Kit screenshot with ambiguous icons]" src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/google-unclear-icons1.png" style="max-width:100%; width:100%; height:auto; text-align:center; margin:0 auto; display:block;">
        </p>

        <h4>White diamond</h4>
        <p>
          If you direct your attention to the first benefit in the screenshot, "Components
          for nearly any app, out of the box", you can see what <em>could</em> have been
          a box in an alternate life...if that life were 45 degrees to the left or right.
          The only way I can possibly see this icon being justifiable is if it were rotated
          to look like a box instead of a diamond. Even then I expect a little more from a
          company like Google. In under 30 seconds I can imagine further additions such as
          a box with an open lid and confetti/items coming out of it.
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of what it <em>could</em> be, it isn't what it <em>should</em>
          be: able to convey - at a glance - its relationship to its content. The
          content and the icon should be one cohesive unit, both delivering (with one
          reinforcing the other) a single message. When scanning the page, seeing that
          icon only causes confusion.
        </p>

        <h4>White chevron</h4>
        <p>
          "Framework-free, or framework-compatible". This icon choice seems a little
          out of nowhere. Unless the chevron pointing up is supposed to correspond
          with the last line of text, "It's up to you," I'm not sure I get the
          relationship between the two. I'm unsure of what relationship, if any,
          the chevron has to frameworks. I <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chevron">consulted Wikipedia</a>
          in case I was missing out on some greater connection, but, alas, I was not.
        </p>

        <p>
          Consulting with <a href="http://ashleighgraden.com" target="_blank">a friend</a>
          in the area of information science, she brings up the impact of these choices on cognitive burden,
        </p>

        <blockquote>
          <p>
            Icons that are not universally recognizable naturally increase cognitive
            burden and are typically nothing more than wasted space on a webpage,
            but can be justified if they fit the cultural semantics of the target
            user group.  These icons increase cognitive burden two-fold by being
            neither universal nor recognizable to a particular user group given
            Google's international audience. They are extremely problematic.
          </p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>
          Confusion ensues again for our dear user, while the rest of us try to piece
          together Google's thought process.
        </p>

        <h3>Gamespot</h3>
        <p>
          Offender number 2 is a company that reports on video game news, writes
          video game reviews, and offers previews of video games. Their presence
          is restricted to online, so you'd hope they make a point of concerning
          themselves with the experience they give their users. I won't say that
          they <em>don't</em>, but this hiccup is a questionable offense, and one
          that could have been avoided by more extensive research or user testing.
        </p>

        <h4>User Testing</h4>
        <p>
          To test the understanding of the toggle button's implied function, I conducted
          a small experiment. I would show images of the toggle to a group of people ask
          them what they thought it did. To ensure I didn't influence any opinions, I asked
          the question and supplied a screenshot over Facebook Messenger and gave only a
          few concise sentences to explain the button's environment.
        </p>

        <p>
          I held two tests: one where only the button is shown on its own, and the
          next showing the button in its location on the web page. Here's the first
          image of just the toggle button,
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gamespot-unclear-toggle.png" alt="[Gamespot unclear toggle button]" style="max-width:100%;">
        </p>

        <p>
          and here are the results:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>"Audio? The 'a' could be for audio."</li>
          <li>"Automatic? Hmm. Uppercase to lowercase?"</li>
          <li>"Is it alphabetized sorting?"</li>
          <li>"I don't know. Some sort of quiz and you switch the slider to choose an answer?"</li>
          <li>"Maybe its a slider that lets you choose between two options! One of them being option A!"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          After gathering the initial responses without showing where on the site
          the toggle was located, it's obvious that no one had any clue. The toggle's
          design is clearly not universal enough to be understood and is therefore
          useless until a user interacts with it. However, knowing that clicks are
          spent sparingly by users means that an interaction may never come anyway.
        </p>

        <p>
          Naturally, I asked the same people again, but this time showing them where
          the toggle was located on the web page. Listed below is the second image,
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gamespot-unclear-toggle-context.png" alt="[Gamespot unclear toggle button location on web page]" style="max-width:100%;">
        </p>

        <p>
          and here was the follow-up response:
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>"Audio. That's all I can think for 'A'."</li>
          <li>"Font size?"</li>
          <li>"Font size."</li>
          <li>"Some sort of like...anti-spoiler button?"</li>
          <li>"Alternate site view?"</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          It's interesting to look at just how scattered the guesses were for the
          experiment. This is telling of how universally unrecognizable the toggle
          button design is, and just how uncertain users become when they come across
          something online that isn't what they expect--or rather, what they've come
          to expect.
        </p>

        <p>
          By the way, the correct answer was day and night/light and dark mode.
          Clicking the toggle gives an alternate view of the site by changing the
          background and text colours for an easier reading experience depending on
          your environment or preference. Examples of the change are inserted below,
        </p>

        <p>
          <img src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gamespot-light-mode.png" alt="[Gamespot unclear toggle button light mode]" style="max-width:100%;">
        </p>
        <p>
          <img src="https://danieldafoe.files.wordpress.com/2015/06/gamespot-dark-mode.png" alt="[Gamespot unclear toggle button light mode]" style="max-width:100%;">
        </p>

        <p>
          Had Gamespot thought a little more about this, they may have come to the
          conclusion that there are better choices to denote a light and dark mode.
          How about a sun and moon?  How about including some sort of label such as
          "Reading mode" above the toggle? How about a light switch? As you can see,
          there were definitely alternatives.
        </p>

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <p>
          In closing, not even the most powerful companies or established news sites
          are perfect when user experience is concerned. You can't ignore the experience
          that users have when viewing pages on your domain, and you cannot overlook
          the importance of how users will interact with the pages you present to them.
          Thanks for checking in and stay tuned for the 2nd entry of User Experience Gripes.
