          A crowd of people had gathered to stand before a thin, feeble looking man in an olive suit. His dull gray hair was slicked back with a glue-like substance, pulling his delicate strands of light gray hair away from the crooked smile his countenance wore.
        </p>

        <p>
          The stage that the man in the olive suit stood upon was a foot higher than the crowd's eye-level, forcing strain upon the necks of the crowd that tried to get a good view of him.
        </p>

        <p>
          The man's words came with sharp ferocity as he began to produce sounds by way of smacking his silver lips. The language sounded foreign and garbled, their intended meaning distorted.
        </p>

        <p>
          Particular persons among the crowd began to raise and lower their hands in an impassive manner, as if compelled to dance to the strange tones of the man on the stage. Each hand raised and retracted was acknowledged in the reflection of the mirror which stood beside the man.
        </p>

        <p>
          Turner Lucent observed the crowd's phlegmatic faces, beholden to them his entertainment for this evening. He had intended on being home tonight with his wife, but he had earlier received word about an auction on today's date.
        </p>

        - the mirror's reflection travels faster than light, causing it to display the reflection of one day in the future instead of current
        - Turner Lucent is the main character and has a wife (perhaps they were unable to conceive?)
        - at one point Turner is explaining to her the mirror when her back is to it--he sees in the reflection that her back has a knife portruding from it, with blood running down her back
        - "It's true always that decisions have impact on not only ourselves."
