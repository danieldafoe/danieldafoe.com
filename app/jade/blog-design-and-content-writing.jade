  h1 Blog Design and Content Writing
  p.
    As a fairly new venture, my personal blogging website is still very much #[em in the works]. Though presentable enough to make it live, I am far from calling it complete.
  
  p.
    To make sure I got something a little more technical out of a blog website instead of simply content creation, I decided to throw myself into to the world of Drupal, a big player in the Content Management System (CMS) world.
  
  p.
    #[strong Update:] As of July 2015, I have decided to switch from using Drupal as my blogging platform to using straightforward static pages. Due to performance hits I took with Drupal and being unable to diagnose them, I've decided to go this route.
  
  p.
    The plan is to move to serving my static blog pages using Jekyll, but this will be changed over when I have time to do so. This change was quick and so I felt comfortable spending some time on it.

  h3 Rationale
  p.
    After aquainting myself with the documentation I decided to dive right into styling my own Drupal theme in order to make it look how I wanted, and then made sure I perused the administration aspect to give my blogs clean URLs to improve SEO. Aside from learning more about Drupal administration, I also plan on getting into the PHP files to further customize.

  p.
    One thing that is not acceptable about this project is the server response time. The blog appears to load very slowly and does not receive favourable scores on PageSpeed Insights. I have therefore been taking steps to improve the speed of my Drupal blog in order to better acquiant myself with best practices for optimization.
