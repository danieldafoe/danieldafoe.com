  h1 Description
  
  p.
    Sassy Comments is an intuitive Sass commenting package for Sublime Text 2/3 available with compatibility for all operating systems. (Yes, Linux too.)

  h3 Rationale
  
  p.
    After #[a(href='http://packagecontrol.io') checking on Package Control] for a decent Sublime Text package that would allow quick, meaningful comment shortcuts for Sass, I came to the conclusion there wasn't one.
  p.
    This stirred a certain altruistic sense in me, and so I forked a repo on Github and created my own vision for a commenting system.
