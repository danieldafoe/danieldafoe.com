All the code that displays [https://danieldafoe.com](danieldafoe.com) lives here.

This is a place where I can be creative, and **being creative is important to me**. I get to choose my own words and
control the experience my visitors receive. I'm responsible for all of it.

It may not be much, but this personal website has been a place for me to test everything from static site 
generators (e.g., Jekyll, Gatsby), JavaScript frameworks (e.g., Angular 2, React), CSS pre-processors (e.g., Sass), and more.
